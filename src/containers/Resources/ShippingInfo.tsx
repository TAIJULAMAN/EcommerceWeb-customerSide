          Via Trading has developed and fostered relationships with a wide
          network of carriers to bring you the most competitive shipping rates
          available. Shipping wholesale liquidation merchandise is often not as
          straightforward as shipping regular goods. At Via Trading we use a
          variety of materials to package and ship our merchandise, the most
          common being cases, bins, gaylords or shrink-wrapped pallets. Orders
          are typically shipped by Courier (Fedex), LTL (Less than Load)
          Carriers, Full Trailers or Containers. Own pick-up is also available.
          The cost of shipping by Courier or LTL is typically determined by the
          distance between origin & destination of the goods, the type of
          destination, the type of merchandise and the weight or quantity of the
          merchandise being shipped. The cost of shipping by Full Truckload or
          Ocean Container is typically determined by the distance between the
          origin and the destination of the goods. We typically ship out orders
          within 24 hours of payment though we do also offer same day shipping
          whenever possible. Domestic US shipments typically take 1 to 7
          business days to reach their destination. Overseas air shipments can
          take 5-15 business days to reach their destination. Container
          shipments can take up anywhere from 15 to 60 days to reach their
          destination.The following sections will illustrate how shipping works
          in the wholesale industry, what options are available to you and what
          you can do to minimize your overall shipping costs. You may get
          Real-Time Shipping Quotes online or by calling or emailing us with
          what is you would like to order.

          Things to keep in mind:{" "}
        </h2>
        {/* desscription */}
        <ol>
          <li>
            • Generally, pallet deliveries to a residence will require a
            lift-gate to lower the pallets to the ground.
          </li>
          <li>
            • Carriers charge more for home delivery and lift-gate use. If you
            have the option to receive your order at a friend’s place of
            business or pick-up from the local terminal it could it could save
            you some money.
          </li>
          <li>
            • For insurance and safety reasons, trucking carriers do not allow
            customers to climb onto the truck to manually unload their pallets.
            Commercial locations, if not equipped with a loading dock or
            forklift, will also require a lift-gate. LTL carriers charge extra
            for residential deliveries. Typically they will levy a flat fee of
            between $25-$75. Carriers also charge extra for trucks with
            lift-gates, typically a flat fee of around $25-$75.
          </li>
          <li>
            • Deliveries are to curbside or to the loading dock. Drivers will
            not deliver your pallet(s) into your garage or inside your storage
            space, so be prepared to bring the items inside yourself or with the
            help of a friend.
          </li>
          <li>
            • You will need to verify the pallets and shrink-wrap before signing
            the Bill of Lading upon delivery (or make annotations on it before
            signing it). If your pallet shows signs of having been opened,
            rummaged through, stolen from or otherwise tampered with during
            shipping, it is your responsibility to make a note of this on the
            Bill of Lading BEFORE you accept the merchandise. Should there have
            been any theft or loss during transit, failure to make annotations
            will significantly lower the chances of receiving any kind of
            compensation from the shipping company.
          </li>
          <li>
            • Shipments are sent with minimal insurance ($0.50/lb to $1/lb). If
            you are shipping very expensive merchandise, please ask for
            additional insurance.

          Truckloads generally refer to a 48’ or 53’ truck filled with
          merchandise on pallets or hand-loaded. Truckloads usually cost a flat
          rate to ship based on the destination and mileage, irrespective of
          whether the truck is full or half empty. Larger orders that cannot be
          shipped economically as LTLs can often be cheaper to ship as a full
          load. Truckloads can be ordered with or without a lift-gate. Trucks
          with lift-gates can often be costly and it may be cheaper to rent a
          forklift for a day to assist you in unloading the truck. The latter is
          especially true when the merchandise is traveling long distances.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4  text-sm text-[#808080] sm:text-base lg:mb-4">
          Typically, 26 pallets can fit comfortably onto the floor of a 53’
          truck bed with no double-stacking. However, many types of pallets can
          be double-stacked (assuming height is not greater than 4’) to allow
          between 26-52 pallets to be put on the truck, minimizing your overall
          landed cost per pallet. Some goods can be consolidated further or even
          hand-loaded (for example, a 70 pallet load may be able to be
          consolidated into 52 pallets; or 2 full loads may be able to be
          hand-loaded into a single truck).
